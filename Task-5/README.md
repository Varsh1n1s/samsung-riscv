## **Overview of Intruder Detection Using IR Sensor and VSDSquadron Mini**

Intruder detection systems are widely used in security applications to monitor unauthorized access to restricted areas. This project utilizes an **Infrared (IR) sensor** and **VSDSquadron Mini**, a small yet powerful FPGA development board, to implement an efficient and real-time intruder detection system.

The system works by detecting movement using an **IR sensor**, which senses infrared radiation emitted by objects, particularly human bodies. When an intruder crosses the sensorâ€™s range, it triggers a signal that is processed by the **VSDSquadron Mini**, which then activates an alert mechanism, such as a buzzer or LED indication. This setup can be further extended to send notifications or trigger alarms for enhanced security.

## **Introduction**
Security is a critical concern in both residential and industrial settings. Traditional surveillance systems, like CCTV cameras, often require continuous human monitoring, making them inefficient in terms of cost and manpower. Automated **Intruder Detection Systems** provide a reliable alternative by using **motion sensors and microcontrollers or FPGAs** to detect unauthorized access in real-time.

This project employs an **IR sensor** to detect motion and **VSDSquadron Mini**, an FPGA-based development board, to process signals and control output responses. **FPGAs** offer advantages such as parallel processing, real-time operation, and flexibility in implementing customized security solutions.

The **primary objectives** of this project are:
- To detect unauthorized intrusions using an **IR sensor**.
- To process sensor data efficiently using **VSDSquadron Mini**.
- To trigger an appropriate response, such as an alarm or alert system.
- To explore the **real-time capabilities of FPGA-based security systems**.

This system is highly scalable and can be enhanced with additional features like **wireless communication, multiple sensor integration, and AI-based detection algorithms** for advanced security applications.
